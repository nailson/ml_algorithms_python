# Fundamental Machine Learning Algorithms with Python

The purpose of this repository is to develop from scratch the fundamental ML algorithms and revise the concepts.
**It's very important to mention that this idea caught me in global quarantine times.

## Naive Bayes

* [Naive Bayes Multinomial/Bernoulli](https://github.com/nailson/ml_algorithms_python/blob/master/naive_bayes_classifier/NaiveBayesClassifier.py): Use only categorical features (both binomial or multinomial distributions) to do the classification.

* [Naive Bayes Gaussian](https://github.com/nailson/ml_algorithms_python/blob/master/naive_bayes_classifier/NaiveBayesClassifier.py): Use only numerical features (with the assumption of normallity of the data) to do the classification.

## Decision Tree

* [ID3](https://github.com/nailson/ml_algorithms_python/blob/master/decision_tree/decision_tree.py) (Iterative Dichotomiser 3): was developed in 1986 by Ross Quinlan. The algorithm creates a multiway tree, finding for each node (i.e. in a greedy manner) the categorical feature that will yield the largest information gain for categorical targets. Trees are grown to their maximum size and then a pruning step is usually applied to improve the ability of the tree to generalise to unseen data.

## KNN
* [Euclidean Distance K Nearest Neighbours ](https://github.com/nailson/ml_algorithms_python/blob/master/knn/knn.py): is a non-parametric method proposed by Thomas Cover used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space.
